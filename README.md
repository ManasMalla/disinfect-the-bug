# Disinfect the Bug

A sample web application built with the Next.Js framework to demonstrate debugging tools like loggers, stack traces, breakpoints, etc.

## Getting started 

Clone this project with the `starter` branch.

`/`: The entry point to the application that allows users to authenticate and automatically navigates signed-in users with the help of `gdg_token` saved to `local_storage`.

`/home`: The authenticated home page that fetches a list of posts based on the `gdg_token` and displays them in the `list-detail pane`.
